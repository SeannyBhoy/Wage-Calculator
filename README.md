# Wage-Calculator
Baby's first .exe, a wage calculator built in Python with overtime and tax included
Fairly straight forward. Just put in hours worked and your hourly rate and it'll do all of the calculations.
Not exactly intended for wide use. Just a little experiment and my first coding project to see how I could play with GUI elements.
Currently I live in Ontario so all overtime and tax calculations are based on Ontario labor laws. I still included the basic Gross so it still works as a
regular calculator.
